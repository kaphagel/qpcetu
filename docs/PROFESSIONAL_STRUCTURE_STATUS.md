- Moved and reorganized existing documentation into logical categories
- Cross-referenced documentation with clear navigation structure

### **Step 4: Dependencies Organization** ✅
- Created professional `deps/` directory structure:
  - `deps/external/libmodbus/` - Industrial Modbus TCP library with full source
  - `deps/toolchain/mxe-lite/` - Windows cross-compilation environment
  - `deps/windows/libmodbus-windows/` - Pre-built Windows libraries
- Safe dependency management with proper Git submodule handling
- Updated build scripts to use new dependency structure
- Comprehensive dependency documentation in `deps/README.md`
- Verified cross-platform builds after reorganization

### **Step 5: Professional Testing Framework** ✅
- Implemented comprehensive Qt5 Test framework with enterprise standards:
  - `tests/unit/` - Isolated component testing (2 comprehensive test suites)
  - `tests/integration/` - Component interaction testing (1 test suite)
  - `tests/mocks/` - Professional mock implementations (3 mock classes)
- Professional test infrastructure:
  - `scripts/run-tests.sh` - Comprehensive test runner with coverage support
  - CMake integration with CTest framework
  - Cross-platform test execution (Linux/Windows)
  - Coverage reporting with lcov/gcov integration
- Quality assurance features:
  - Signal/slot testing with QSignalSpy
  - Async operation testing with timeouts
  - Error condition simulation and validation
  - Memory management and performance benchmarks

### **Step 6: Continuous Integration & Quality Assurance** ✅
- Implemented comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions:
  - 8-job professional pipeline: Quality analysis, builds, testing, security, documentation
  - Cross-platform automated builds (Linux native + Windows cross-compilation)
  - Professional quality gates with configurable thresholds
- Advanced quality assurance framework:
  - `scripts/qa-validation.sh` - Comprehensive QA validation script
  - Static analysis with CPPCheck and Clang-Tidy
  - Code coverage analysis with 85% minimum threshold
  - Memory leak detection with Valgrind integration
  - Performance testing with automated benchmarking
  - Security scanning with Semgrep integration
- Professional development standards:
  - `.editorconfig` - Cross-editor consistency standards
  - `.clang-format` - C++ code formatting rules (Qt5 optimized)
  - `.github/quality-assurance.yml` - QA configuration and thresholds
- Docker integration:
  - `Dockerfile.ci` - Multi-stage CI/CD container environments
  - `docker-compose-ci.yml` - Complete pipeline orchestration
